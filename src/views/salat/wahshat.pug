          | It's mustahab (recommended) that on the first night after the burial of the deceased, between Maghrib and 
          | Isha one should recite two rakats prayer. This is known as Namaz-e-Wahshat because for the dead person the 
          | most horrifying and difficult is the first night.

          | عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ، قال : ( لا يأتي على الميت أشد من الليلة الأولى ، فارحموا موتاكم بالصدقة ، فمن لم يجد فليصل ركعتين 
        p
          | If unable to recite on the first night, then may be recited on the second or even third night after burial. However, the recommendation is to perform charity first, and also its only recommended that the wali of the deceased recites the prayer (and not everyone), since the hadith quoted above explicitly says 'one of you may recite'
