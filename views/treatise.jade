            | Treatise on Rights

        p 
          | In addition to Sahifa-e-Sajjadiya, Treatise on Rights is one of Imam's most outstanding teachings. 
          | It is a master document on Islamic human rights, which not only cover human rights, but they also include
          | the rights of God, rights of our body parts, deeds, relatives, neighbours, leaders ,subjects, adversaries, creditors 
          | and so on. To any intelligent reader who ponders deeply about the contents of this valuable document on rights, 
          | it immediately becomes clear that Islam etablished the first comprehensive charter on rights nearly fourteen centuries

          | upon you to observe them and exert all efforts to fulfill them. You should seek God the Majesticâ€™s help in 
          | this respect. And there is no power or strength but in God. And all praise is due to God the Lord of the Worlds.
