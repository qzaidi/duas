        h1 The Supplications
        p
          | At all phases of his life, Imam Sajjad(s) spent his time in supplication and prayers. His 
          | keenness in supplication and prayers was so strange that wherever his sacred name is called, mourning, 
          | insistence in worship, invocations and prayers will come to our mind.
        p
          | These fifty four invocations of Sahifeh are manifestations of the great soul of that Imam.
