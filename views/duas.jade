            | The Supplications

        p
          | At all phases of his life, Imam Sajjad(s) spent his time in supplication and prayers. His 
          | keenness in supplication and prayers was so strange that wherever his sacred name is called, mourning, 
          | insistence in worship, invocations and prayers will come to our mind. Sahifa-e-Kamela, also known as the 
          | Psalms of Islam, is a collection of those invocations.
