        h1 Treatise on Rights
        p 
          | Imam Sajjad (a) attempted to establish a divine relationship between the people and God. Consequently, he was able to touch the
          | hearts of the people and the people were deeply influenced by his words and his life style.In addition to Sahifa-e-Sajjadiya, 
          | Treatise on Rights is one of his most outstanding teachings. It is a master document on Islamic human rights, which not only
          | cover human rights, but they also include the rights of God, our parts, and our deeds. To any intelligent reader who ponders 
          | deeply about the contents of this valuable document on rights, it immediately becomes clear that Islam has already established the 
          | first document on rights nearly fourteen centuries ago.
